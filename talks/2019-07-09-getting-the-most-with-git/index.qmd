## Abstract

Do you wonder what a pull request is? Do you browse GitHub and see lots of repositories with fancy looking badges, and think, I would like some of them? And what is a git-hook and why should you care? In this tutorial, we'll look at how we can leverage external tools, such as travis, covr, and Docker hub.
