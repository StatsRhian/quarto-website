## Abstract

Humans are notoriously bad at dealing with randomness and probabilities - we ignore the obvious and see patterns in the ordinary. As a statistician, it's Rhian's job to decide whether differences in data are due to chance or a real underlying cause. Rhian will tell stories of real projects she has worked on from predicting your personality to analysing your deodorant and discuss the pitfalls that we as humans often struggle with when it comes to randomness.
