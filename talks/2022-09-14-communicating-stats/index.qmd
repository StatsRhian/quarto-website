## Abstract

The RSS Statistical Ambassadors have been selected and trained by the Society to engage in statistical discussions with the media, schools and wider public.

This group session will actively engage the audience through a number of exercises to stretch attendees' communication skills. The Ambassadors will provide advice and guidance to encourage attendees to communicate complex statistical ideas and concepts in plain language, and to consider alternative ways to communicate their own research.

The session aims to help statisticians prepare to give insightful comments, whether written, via social media, on radio, or in television interviews.
