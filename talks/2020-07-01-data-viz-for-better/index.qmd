## Abstract

It is sometimes said that Florence Nightingale was the first person to present data in a visual form. This is not true, however, she may have been the first person to use data visualisation to persuade people of the need for change. In this talk, I will show Florence's original diagrams and discuss how she used them to argue a case for better hospital management. I'll also showcase the Florences of the future, highlighting women who are using data visualisation to bring change in today's world.
