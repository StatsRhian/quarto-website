## Abstract

In this talk, Rhian will share stories of how Jumping Rivers develop in both R and Python - often in the same project. Rhian will share how they write all of their Python training materials in R Markdown, and how they built the Diffify tool to analyse R packages in both Python and R. Rhian will also talk a little about the challenges and opportunities they have working within a bilingual team at Jumping Rivers.
