## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data science leader, statistical consultant and R expert, based in the U.K. 

I'm passionate about using statistics to help people make data driven decisions.

I'm currently Technical Lead of Data Science at [Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com). 

Iâ€™m an active communicator and a statistical ambassador for the Royal Statistical Society, helping journalists and the members of the public understand statistical concepts. 

When Iâ€™m not at a laptop, youâ€™ll find me outdoors. I love cycling, sea kayaking, fell running and climbing.
