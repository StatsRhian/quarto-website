I don't particularly enjoy cooking. But I *do* enjoy making irrelevant websites. When I do cook, I like having a tried and tested recipe to follow. I decided to use {bookdown} to put all of my standard recipes into a nice, searchable, [version controlled, online book](https://statsrhian.github.io/recipes/).
