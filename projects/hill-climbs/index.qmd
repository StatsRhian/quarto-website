I like cycling. I'm not great at going fast, but I quite enjoy puffing my way to the top of a hill.

When I first started playing with the {leaflet}, I mapped the [local hill climbs.](https://github.com/statsrhian/hill-climbs)


```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(magrittr)
lancashire = sf::st_read("lancashire_climbs/lancashire_climbs.shp", quiet = TRUE)

leaflet::leaflet() %>%
  leaflet::addTiles() %>%
  leaflet::addPolylines(data = lancashire, col = ~col, label = ~name)
```
